## Flavonoids Summary

    • This is my first try at summarizing data from Flav_R03-3.accdb, Isoflav_R2-1.accdb, PA02-1.accdb, FDB-EXP_R01-1.accdb
    • Created database that combines flavonoid databases, kept nomenclature and schema almost the same
    • All steps to combine tables are in stored procedures or sql scripts
    • These flavonoids help maintain health through cardioprotective, anti-cancer, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity
